The requesting terminal will have a mode for requesting by id and by name
The mainframe will receive requests, and send the name to a translator
The translator will convert the name into the item id, and send it back to the Mainframe
The mainframe will send the id to the inventory modules

Modules can currently only handle named requests, should be solved by an alias system the mainframe talks to

Mainframe will hold a list of all stored items, and the id's of the computers servicing those inventories.
